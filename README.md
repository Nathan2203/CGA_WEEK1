# CGA_WEEK1
This project is done using DEV C++. To open or run this project, make sure to install all things to use Graphic in Dev C++ (graphics.h, libgi.a, winbgim.h, ConsoleAppGraphics.template, ConsoleApp_cpp_graph.txt).
You can download it at (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wciBDegq3NqMPjg0V5-y6bo8ebNWVoE4?usp=sharing).

Configuring DevC++

Step 1: Download the DevC++ (https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/).

Step 2: Download the Graphics header files, and etc stuff needed from the given link.

Step 3: Extract the contents of the rar file.

Step 4: Go to the location where DevC++ is installed. For me it's C:\Program Files (x86). Go inside the MinGW64 folder. Copy the graphics.h and winbgim.h in the "include" folder and C:\Program Files (x86)\Dev-Cpp\MinGW64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\include folder.

Step 5:Copy the libbgi.a file into lib folder and in D:\Dev-Cpp\MinGW64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib folder.

Step 6: Copy the ConsoleAppGraphics.template, ConsoleApp_cpp_graph.txt files and paste them inside the "template" folder of the devc++ installer location (for me, it's C:\Program Files (x86)\Dev-Cpp\template).

Step 7: Open the Project1 file and Compile & Run.

Thank you hope you enjoy it :D
